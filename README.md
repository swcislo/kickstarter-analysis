Of the 525 successful US kickstarter campaigns for theater, only 67 had a goal of 12,000.00 or more. Of the 525 successful theater campaigns, 414 were plays. Of the successful play campaigns, 36 had a goal of 12,000 or more.

The mean goal for successful play kickstarter campaigns was $5,049.00. The mean pledged for the successful play kickstarter campaigns was $5,602.00 which exceeds the mean goal. The mean goal for failed play kickstarter campaigns was $10,554.00 which is less than the goal for your proposed kickstarter campaign. The mean pledged amount for the failed play campaigns was $559.00. 

A phased approach for the your kickstarter campaign with multiple goals may prove more successful than a single kickstarter campaign based on the data. We also suggest selecting the start of the campaigns in the following months May, June, and July.
