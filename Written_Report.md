# Kickstarting with Excel

## Purpose and Background
 An analyis was performed on Kickstarter Campaigns utilizing data from 4,114 Kickstarter Campaigns from May 7, 2009 through March 15, 2017. The data contained data from 21 countries. The Kickstarter Campaign data covers 9 parent categories and 41 subcategories. The purpose of the analysis was to provide you with information on fundraising campaigns for plays specific to launch dates and fundraising goals to assist with your decisions for the fundraising campaign for your play *Fever*.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I reviewed the provided fundraising data. I filtered the fundraising data by the Parent Category Theater. Using the data on theaters, the data was separated by 
Outcome: successful, failed and canceled. The results were filtered by launch month. In total, 1,369 fundraising campaigns were reviewed.

For the 1,369 theater fundraising campaigns, the results were as follows:
-839 were successful
-493 failed 
-37 were cancelled

Of the successful campaigns, the most successful launch months were May, June and July. The least successful launch months were December, November, January and 
March. Please see the following graph.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Of the successful campaigns, the most successful launch months were May, June and July. The least successful launch months were December, November, January and 
March. Please see the following graph.

Next, the outcome based on fundraising goals for plays was evaluated. For successful play fundraising campaigns, the most successful goal range was from 1,000 to 4,
999. The least successful goal range was 45,000 to 49,999. For the fundraising range 0 to 14,999, the percentage of successful campaigns exceeded the percentage of 
failed campaigns. For the range 15,000 to 19,999, the successful campaigns to failed campaigns was 50/50. Once the range increased over 20,000 fundraising 
campaigns were more likely to fail than be successful. Please see the following graph.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
In order to provide a more precise analysis, more information such as the month you launched your campaign, the fundraising goal, the specific type of play, and 
the location where you plan on showcasing your play.

If more detailed data was available to more closely match the specific genre of play as well as location, a more precise analysis could be conducted.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? The most successful months to launch a campaign were May, June and July. The least successful months were December, November, Janaury and March.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? Campaigns 20,000 and above are less likely to be successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset? The data location could be refined to more closely match the location of *Fever*. The genre of play could be refined to more closely match *Fever*.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? The length of a fundraising campaign could be created to try and predict if the *Fever* campaign can still be successful. If more precise data was available, the location for successful campaigns could be reviewed if Louise was agreeable to changing locations.
